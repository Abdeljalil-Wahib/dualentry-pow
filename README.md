✨ Key Features

AI-Categorize Simulation: A mock "AI" agent that identifies uncategorized transactions and intelligently assigns categories based on description keywords (e.g., "AWS" -> "Infrastructure").

Optimistic UI: The "AI-Categorize" button conditionally renders only when needed and handles loading states gracefully.

Component Architecture: Built using a reusable Design System (Badge, Button, Card) for scalability.
